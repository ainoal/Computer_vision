The given point is a homogeneous point. It represents a point in
the Euclidean space

Transforming the point with the camera frame projection matrix M:
(X, Y, Z, W) = (1, 0, 1, 0)
M = [-f 0 0 0;
    0 -f 0 0;
    0 0 1 0]

M * (X, Y, Z, W) = (-f, 0, 1)

When you divide the x and y coordinates by z, you get
the projected coordinates (-f, 0) on the image plane.

The point's projection is along the negative x axis, depending
on the depth of field.

Which Euclidean points project to the same location?
- Points (a, 0, a)
All points with the same x- and z- coordinates and y-coordinate 0
in the Euclidian space project to the same location. This can be
proved as follows:

M * (a, 0, a, 0) = (-af, 0, a)
When you divide the x- and y- coordinates of the projected coordinates,
you get (-af/a, 0/a) = (-f, 0).

For estimating how far a point is from the camera, this can pose a problem.
However, the projection tells us the direction in which a point is relative
to the camera. 

*********************
If we are also able to tell whether the point is on focus or not, we can
find out things about the distance based on the depth of field.
